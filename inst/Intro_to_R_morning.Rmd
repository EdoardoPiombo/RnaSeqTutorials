## Objectives of the morning

- What is R
- Loading packages in R
- Work with dataframes with the tidyverse package
- make and export simple plots

## What is R?
R is a programming language, used mostly for statistics.

It has many concepts similar to Bash (the language you have been using up until now).

For loops and scripts, for example, are all concepts that also exist in R.

However, R is mostly used in an interactive manner to explore data and
generate plots, rather than through scripts.


## Differences with bash 1
The basic syntax of commmands is:

command(object, option=OptionValue)

And not

command --option OptionValue object

For example, to see the first 2 elements of a list you do this:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins_vector <- c('Fred','Betty','Brigitta', 'Ulf')
head(penguins_vector, n=2)
```

While in bash you would write:

head -n 2 penguins.txt


## Obligatory penguins image
Here are penguins


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/penguins1.jpg")
```




## Differences with bash 2
Most of what you will do in R is done by assigning meaning to variables.

It is rare to use the full pathway to files in R, contrary to what you did last week in bash. This is expecially true because most files are imported as a specific kind of variable

To assign a vaue to a variable, we use "<-".

The 2 main kind of variables we will use are:

- vectors, storing one or more values of the same kind

- dataframes, storing one or more (possibly) named vectors of equal length


## Vectors
You can make vectors in the terminal or import them from existing files

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
penguins_vector <- c('Fred','Betty','Brigitta', 'Ulf')
penguins_from_file <- readLines("penguins.txt")
head(penguins_from_file)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/penguins3.jpg")
```


## We can do the same with dataframes

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins_data <- data.frame(
  Weight = c(4.5, 3.2, 5.1, 2.9),
  species = c("Adelie", "Gentoo", "Chinstrap", "Adelie")
)
head(penguins_data)
dim(penguins_data)
colnames(penguins_data)
rownames(penguins_data)
```


## But we can have much bigger dataframes if we load them from files!
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins_data <- read.csv("penguins.csv")
dim(penguins_data)
```

We can also load dataframes through R packages with the library() command

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')

dim(penguins)
```


## Library() usually loads new functions
While some packages contain datasets, the most common use of "library()" is to load new functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
penguins <- penguins
```

For example, we will load the package "tidyverse" to work with our penguins:


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

And now we can use the "select" function to choose a single column of our dataframe

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
select(penguins, species)
```

## Doing filtering with tidyverse
So to be fair selecting a column in a dataframe is not difficult, and 
you do not need tidyverse to do it:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
head(penguins$species, n = 2)
```

But tidyverse has many more useful functions!
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
filter(penguins, species=='Adelie')
```

## Connecting commands in R

So you loved the "|" from last week, right?

Good news! The same thing exists in R!

You print it with the shortcur "Ctrl+Shift+M"

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins %>% filter(species!='Adelie') %>% 
  select(island) %>% dim()
```

## Create or modify columns with tidyverse
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins %>% mutate(New= bill_length_mm + 10) %>%
  select(New) %>% head()
```

## Creating new text columns
Mutate also works with text, if you combine it with the paste command:
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins %>% mutate(Descr= paste(species, island, 'cute', sep='_')) %>%
  select(Descr) %>% head(n=4)
```


## Dropping NAs
There are some NA value in our penguin dataset. There are several ways to deal with them:

- Dropping rows that have them
- Substituting NA values with the mean or median value of their column

As I am lazy we will just drop them:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins <- penguins %>%  drop_na()
```

Notice that this is the first time I really modify the penguins dataset, as before I did not use "<-"

## Final concept before exercises: plotting stuff

Looking at science numbers is very boring, while looking at science images is only moderately boring!

As we aim to the state of moderate boredom, we can use an R package called ggplot2 (included in tidyverse) to make plots about our dataset!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/plotting.jpg")
```




## Basics of ggplot2
This package is very flexible, and allows you to build a plot "step by step".

In most cases you start with ggplot() and supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()). You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()), scales (like scale_colour_brewer()), faceting specifications (like facet_wrap()) and/or coordinate systems (like coord_flip()).

I load the additional package "ggthemes" to have more color options

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggthemes)
```

## The very beginning

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

## Setting axis

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(  data = penguins,
         mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
```

## Adding data

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(  data = penguins, 
        mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Coloring by species

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(  data = penguins, 
        mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color=species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Adding local lm lines

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Adding local lm lines

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Adding global lm line
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Adding global lm line
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Change colors and add title and subtitle
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

## Change colors and add title and subtitle
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

## Data and mapping are the first two arguments by default
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

## A little about visualizing categorical variables
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Ordering columns by number of elements
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_infreq(species))) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Bindwidths can be assigned to numerical variables to visualize them as histograms
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)
  
```

## Exercises:
Find out:

- How much does the heaviest penguin weight? Which species is it and what island does it come from?
- How many penguins are females?
- How many penguins of the Gentoo species are males?
- Which penguin species is most frequent on the Biscoe island?
- Find out how to use the "geom_density" function and use it to visualize the body mass of penguins.
- Use geom_density again, but try to make 3 density lines, one per species.

## In case of problems remember to:

- Relieve stress by being mean with friends and family
- Download this presentation from Canvas to reread the slide
- Google error messages
- Use AI models (carefully, try to understand everything the AI model is telling you)
- Ask the teachers
- Check solutions on Canvas

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/penguins4.jpg")
```
